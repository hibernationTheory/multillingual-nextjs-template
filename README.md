# Multilingual SSR rendered Next.js template

You have a message to get it out there, and you want to communicate it to a global audience. You need the website that will host it to be fast, multilingual and SEO optimized. You also don't need your template to be over-engineered like with complex solutions like Redux. Then this is the template for you.

Inspired by this blog post:
