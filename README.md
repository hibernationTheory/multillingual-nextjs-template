# Multilingual SSR rendered Next.js template

You have a message to get it out there and you want to communicate it to a global audience. You need the website that will host it to be fast, multilingual, SEO optimized and ready to be easily styled. You also don't need your template to be over-engineered with complex solutions like Redux. Then this is the template for you.
